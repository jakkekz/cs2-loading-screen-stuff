1. Download `creator.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/jakkekz/cs2-loading-screen-stuff/releases/tag/latest)
2. Place it in an empty folder
3. In the folder include:
   - **all loading screen images** (max 9)(should be converted to 16:9 png automatically)
   - **one svg map icon**
      - not all svg images are equal (absolute vs relative coordinates), [this](https://www.pngtosvg.com/) converter is recommended
   - **one txt file** with the description text
4. run `creator.exe`
5. Ready! Load the map
   - no recompile needed
   - re-upload to workshop needed
