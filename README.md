## Tutorial:
1. Download `creator.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/jakkekz/cs2-loading-screen-stuff/releases/tag/latest)
2. Place it in an empty folder
3. In the folder include:
   - **All loading screen images** (2-9 images)(should be converted to 16:9 .png automatically)
   - **One .svg map icon**
      - Not all .svg images are equal (absolute vs relative coordinates), [this](https://www.pngtosvg.com/) converter is recommended
   - **One .txt file** with the description text _(Loading... is not removable as far as i know)_
4. Run `creator.exe`
   - If you get a Defender popup click `More info` and `Run anyway`
   - map name has to be the same as addon name
6. Ready! Load the map
   - No recompile needed
   - Re-upload to workshop needed
